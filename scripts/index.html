        <h3>Summary</h3>
        <strong>Measure 3 was designed to do the following:</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Legalize the recreational use of marijuana in the state of North
            Dakota for people 21 years of age or older;
          </li>
          <li>
            Create penalties for the possession or distribution to or by any
            individuals under 21 years of age;
          </li>
          <li>
            Create an automatic expungement process for individuals with
            convictions for a controlled substance that has been legalized; and
          </li>
          <li>
            Eliminate the state of North Dakota's immunity from damages
            resulting from expungement lawsuits.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>FAQ</h3>
<p><strong>What will measure 3 do?</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>End the arrest of responsible adults for marijuana, a substance objectively safer than currently legal alcohol and tobacco. Arresting adults for possessing marijuana infringes on personal freedoms and is a waste of taxpayer dollars and law enforcement resources that can be better spent combating violent crime.</li>
    <li>Create a new job and revenue generating industry for North Dakota's farmers and entrepreneurs. Marijuana would provide a new profit generating crop for North Dakota family farms and the tax revenue generated from the industry could support important state programs such as education and infrastructure development.</li>
    <li>Help combat the opioid crisis. States that have legalized marijuana have seen significant reductions in opioid abuse and overdose fatalities. Thousands of North Dakotans are suffering and legalizing marijuana could help prevent some of the counteless deaths beign caused by this epidemic.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What won't measure 3 do?</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>Change current penalties for driving under the influence. Driving under the influence of marijuana would remain illegal with current penalties in place.</li>
    <li>Legalize possession or sale to minors. Under Measure 3, it will remain illegal to sell or distribute marijuana to minors, it only legalizes activities for those over the age of 21.</li>
    <li>Allow marijuana consumption in public, everywhere. Current public anti-smoking laws will still apply if Measure 3 is approved.</li>

        </ul>
        <h3>Summary</h3>
        <p>
          The initiative proposes a sensible alternative to Michigan’s failed
          policy of marijuana prohibition. It positions Michigan as a national
          leader in the adoption of smart adult-use marijuana laws by allowing
          adults 21 and older to possess and grow certain amounts of marijuana.
          It will create a state-regulated system of licensed marijuana businesses
          that will cultivate, process, test, and sell marijuana and marijuana-infused
          products to adults 21 and older. The proposal also enacts an excise
          tax on marijuana at the retail level in addition to the standard state
          sales tax.
        </p>
        <h3>Talking Points</h3>
        <strong>What should I consider when deciding whether to vote yes or no on Proposal 1?</strong>
        <strong>Tax dollars are wasted on prohibition</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Stops wasting our tax dollars by ending the 20,000 unnecessary
            arrests that happen for marijuana each year.
          </li>
          <li>
            Allows law enforcement to redirect their time to more important
            issues like stopping the opioid epidemic and fighting violent crime.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <strong>Legalizes cannabis and industrial hemp</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Allows adults 21 and older to grow up to 12 total marijuana plants
            in a single residence and possess up to 2.5 ounces of marijuana
            outside of their home.
          </li>
          <li>Positions Michigan as a leader in industrial hemp production.</li>
        </ul>
        <strong>Regulates and taxes the adult use of marijuana</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>Licenses marijuana businesses similar to the state’s 2016 medical marijuana law.</li>
          <li>
            Licenses will be available for cultivators, processors, testing
            facilities, secure transporters and retailers.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <strong>Raises millions for Michigan’s critical needs</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>
            10 percent tax on marijuana sales will generate hundreds of millions
            each year.
          </li>
          <li>New revenue will support roads, schools and local governments</li>

          As of 2018, Missouri has not legalized the use or possession or medical

          The ballot initiative would allow state-licensed physicians to recommend
          marijuana use to patients with nine qualifying conditions and additional
          conditions with doctor's approval. Patients would be allowed to grow six
          flowering plants in their homes; purchase not less than 4 ounces of dried
          marijuana or equivalent in 30-day periods, and possess not less than a
          60-day supply of dried marijuana or equivalent (more permitted with
          written certification from two independent physicians). Amendment 2
          would also tax the sale of medical marijuana at 4 percent and allocate
          revenue from the tax toward providing healthcare services, job training,
          housing assistance, and other services for veterans. Amendment 2 would
          task the Missouri Department of Health and Senior Services with overseeing
          and regulating the state's medical marijuana program. The ballot initiative
          would authorize not less than 24 dispensaries in each of the state's
          eight congressional districts, based on 2018 boundaries.
        </p>
        <h3>Talking points</h3>
        <p>Amendment 2 is:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Pro-patient: Instead of creating a short and restrictive list of
            qualifying conditions, this initiative puts power in the hands of a
            state-licensed physicians, not politicians or bureaucrats, to determine
            who will benefit from medical cannabis.
          </li>
          <li>
            Robust System for Access: The initiative creates a statewide system
            for production and sale of medical cannabis and medical cannabis
            products. It also provides for limited and regulated patient cultivation.
          </li>
          <li>
            Small Tax to Benefit Missouri Veterans: The initiative levies a four
            percent retail tax, and all revenue in excess of the cost of regulating
            the medical cannabis program will go to help Missouri’s veterans.
          </li>
          <li>
            Public Safety: The initiative maintains the current prohibition on
            public use and driving under the influence. It also allows the
            Department of Health and Senior Services to institute a seed-to-sale
            tracking system to ensure that the product and money do not reach the
            illicit market.
          </li>
          <li>
            Regulatory Framework: Puts Missouri Department of Health and Senior
            Services in charge of licensing and implementation, but also allows
            the department to contract with other state agencies when necessary
            for effective and efficient regulation.
          </li>
          <li>
            Quick Implementation: The amendment creates deadlines to make the
            department move quickly to promulgate rules, issue applications, and
            swiftly implement and award patient cards and industry licenses.
          </li>

          Drug Policy. In this election, you’ll have the chance to vote on several
          measures which would give patients access to medical marijuana. Do you
          know how you plan to vote?
        </p>
        <p>
          [Plan to vote against/undecided] - OK. I hope you’ll consider that
          Amendment 2 will help seriously and terminally ill patients to legally
          access safe and regulated medical marijuana. It will also boost tax
          revenue and create jobs while keeping marijuana regulated.
          Thanks for your time. [end conversation]
        </p>
        <p>
          [Plans to vote for Amendment 3 or Prop C, not Amendment 2] – I hope
          you’ll consider that Amendment 2 is a medical marijuana measure backed
          by a broad coalition of patients, physicians, veterans, and groups
          like the Epilepsy Foundation. It imposes a modest 4% tax on medical
          marijuana that would help Missouri veterans. On the other hand,
          Amendment 3 is only backed by personal injury attorney Brad Bradshaw.
          It would put him in charge of the entire medical marijuana program,
          and it would tax medical marijuana at 15% -- the highest rate in the
          country. [end conversation]
        </p>
        <p>
          [Plans to vote for all initiatives] – Amendment 2 is a medical marijuana
          measure backed by a broad coalition of patients, physicians, veterans,

        <h3>Talking Points</h3>
        <strong>Why should I vote on this initiative? The legislature said they would pass it. </strong>
        <p>
          Think of it as a large and important opinion poll. A large percentage
          of “yes” votes will indicate that Utahns care about this issue and want
          to see the the best possible bill passed, whereas a smaller percentage
          of votes will suggest that it’s not important to voters --
          something we know is not true.
        </p>
        <h3>Summary</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Protect terminally and seriously ill patients with specific debilitating medical conditions from arrest and prosecution if using medical cannabis pursuant to their doctor’s recommendation.</li>
          <li>Allow a patient who needs assistance to designate a caregiver to help the patient to obtain and administer their medication. Designated caregivers must pass a background check.</li>
          <li>Permit medical cannabis card holders to obtain no more than two ounces of cannabis or 10 grams of cannabidiol or tetrahydrocannabinol from a licensed dispensary during any 14-day period.</li>
          <li>Maintain prohibitions on the public use of cannabis, driving under the influence of cannabis, and smoking cannabis.</li>
          <li>Establish an electronic verification system administered by the Department of Health and issue medical cannabis cards to qualifying patients while tracking the amount of cannabis purchased by each patient.</li>
          <li>Provide for issuance of four types of medical cannabis business licenses:
            <ul>
              <li>Cannabis cultivation facility</li>
              <li>Cannabis processing facility</li>
              <li>Independent cannabis testing laboratory</li>
              <li>Cannabis dispensary</li>
            </ul>
          <li>Establish restrictions on the number of medical cannabis businesses, including that not more than one cannabis dispensary be licensed for every 150,000 residents in a county, rounded up to the nearest whole number.</li>
          <li>Prohibit felons from owning or working at a medical cannabis business.</li>

          <li>Establish restrictions on the locations of medical cannabis businesses:
            <ul>
              <li>No medical cannabis business may be located within 600 feet of a school, public park or playground, church, or library</li>
              <li>No medical cannabis business may be located within 300 feet of an area zoned exclusively for residential use</li>
              <li>A medical cannabis business must be in compliance with any zoning restrictions enacted by a local government</li>
            </ul>
          <li>Require medical cannabis businesses to use an inventory control system to track cannabis at every step from initial planting to sale.</li>
          <li>Require thorough testing of medical cannabis for potency and contaminants and require that medical cannabis be appropriately labeled and securely packaged.</li>
          <li>Create a system to evaluate competing applications for medical cannabis licenses that will select those applicants for licensure who are best qualified to operate in compliance with the law and to provide affordable medical cannabis to
            patients.</li>
          <li>Allow local governments to require cannabis businesses to obtain a local license and to impose restrictions on cannabis dispensary operations.</li>
          <li>Provide an affirmative defense for medical cannabis related charges that can be used by patients until patient ID cards become available.</li>
          <li>Authorize the cultivation of cannabis without a license by a patient only after January 1, 2021 and only if a cannabis dispensary is not operating within 100 miles of the patient’s home, as long as any cultivation is not within 300
            feet of an area zoned exclusively for residential use or within 600 feet from a community location. This cultivation must take place in an enclosed and locked space.</li>
          <li>Exempt medical cannabis from sales tax.</li>
          <li>Generate sufficient revenue from medical cannabis program fees to offset all expenses of establishing and maintaining the medical cannabis program.</li>
