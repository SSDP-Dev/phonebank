        </ul>
        <h3>Summary</h3>
        <p>
          The initiative proposes a sensible alternative to Michigan’s failed
          policy of marijuana prohibition. It positions Michigan as a national
          leader in the adoption of smart adult-use marijuana laws by allowing
          adults 21 and older to possess and grow certain amounts of marijuana.
          It will create a state-regulated system of licensed marijuana businesses
          that will cultivate, process, test, and sell marijuana and marijuana-infused
          products to adults 21 and older. The proposal also enacts an excise
          tax on marijuana at the retail level in addition to the standard state
          sales tax.
        </p>
        <h3>Talking Points</h3>
        <strong>What should I consider when deciding whether to vote yes or no on Proposal 1?</strong>
        <strong>Tax dollars are wasted on prohibition</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Stops wasting our tax dollars by ending the 20,000 unnecessary
            arrests that happen for marijuana each year.
          </li>
          <li>
            Allows law enforcement to redirect their time to more important
            issues like stopping the opioid epidemic and fighting violent crime.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <strong>Legalizes cannabis and industrial hemp</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Allows adults 21 and older to grow up to 12 total marijuana plants
            in a single residence and possess up to 2.5 ounces of marijuana
            outside of their home.
          </li>
          <li>Positions Michigan as a leader in industrial hemp production.</li>
        </ul>
        <strong>Regulates and taxes the adult use of marijuana</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>Licenses marijuana businesses similar to the state’s 2016 medical marijuana law.</li>
          <li>
            Licenses will be available for cultivators, processors, testing
            facilities, secure transporters and retailers.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <strong>Raises millions for Michigan’s critical needs</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>
            10 percent tax on marijuana sales will generate hundreds of millions
            each year.
          </li>
          <li>New revenue will support roads, schools and local governments</li>
        </ul>

          Hi! My name is (caller), and I'm a volunteer with Students for
           Sensible Drug Policy. In this election, you will be voting on
           Proposal 1, a statewide initiative that will tax and regulate marijuana
          in a manner similar to alcohol - and will generate thousands of jobs
          and hundreds of millions of dollars in tax revenue while allowing law
           enforcement to stop wasting their time arresting 20,000 people each
           year for marijuana and instead focus on more important issues.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you are voting in person, you can find your polling location by
          going to <a href="https://vote.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener">vote.org</a>. Once again, you can find your polling location

        <strong>Why should I vote on this initiative? The legislature said they would pass it. </strong>
        <p>
          Think of it as a large and important opinion poll. A large percentage
          of “yes” votes will indicate that Utahns care about this issue and want
          to see the the best possible bill passed, whereas a smaller percentage
          of votes will suggest that it’s not important to voters --
          something we know is not true.
